## <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMicrochip} /> Profiler

### `/spark profiler`

The `profiler` subcommand is used to control the spark profiler.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.profiler`.

If the profiler is already running in the background, run:
* `/spark profiler upload` to **stop** the profiler and view the results.
* `/spark profiler cancel` to **cancel** the profiler stop it from running in the background.

For basic operation, run:
* `/spark profiler start` to **start** the profiler in the default operation mode.
* `/spark profiler stop` to **stop** the profiler and view the results.
* `/spark profiler info` to check the current **status** of the profiler.

There are some additional flags which can be used to customize the behaviour of the profiler. You can use:
* `/spark profiler start --timeout <seconds>` to start the profiler and **automatically stop** it after x seconds.
* `/spark profiler start --thread *` to start the profiler and track **all threads**.
* `/spark profiler start --alloc` to start the profiler and profile memory allocations (memory pressure) instead of CPU usage.

<summary>Advanced Usage Arguments</summary>
<div>

You can use:
* `/spark profiler start --interval <milliseconds>` to start the profiler and sample at the given interval (default is 4)
* `/spark profiler start --thread *` to start the profiler and track all threads.
* `/spark profiler start --thread <thread name>` to start the profiler and only track specific threads.
* `/spark profiler start --only-ticks-over <milliseconds>` to start the profiler, but only record samples from ticks which take longer than the given duration.
* `/spark profiler start --regex --thread <thread name pattern>` to start the profiler and only track threads matching the given regex.
* `/spark profiler start --combine-all` to start the profiler but combine all threads under one root node.
* `/spark profiler start --not-combined` to start the profiler but disable grouping threads from a thread pool together.
* `/spark profiler start --force-java-sampler` to start the profiler and force usage of the Java sampler, instead of the async one.
* `/spark profiler start --alloc --alloc-live-only` to start the memory allocation profiler, only retaining stats for objects that haven't been garbage collected by the end of the profile
* `/spark profiler start --alloc --interval <bytes>` to start the memory allocation profiler and sample at the given rate in bytes (default is `524287` aka *512 KB*)
* `/spark profiler stop --comment <comment>` to stop the profiler and include the specified comment in the viewer.
* `/spark profiler stop --separate-parent-calls` to stop the profiler and separate calls in the viewer if they were invoked by a different parent method. (*deprecated*)

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHeartbeat} /> Health

### `/spark health`
The `health` subcommand generates a health report for the server, including TPS, CPU, Memory and Disk Usage.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.healthreport`.

You can use:
* `/spark health --memory` to include additional information about the JVMs memory usage
* `/spark health --network` to include additional information about the system network usage

___
### `/spark ping`
The `ping` subcommand prints information about average (or specific) player ping round trip times.

You can use:
* `/spark ping` to view information about the average pings across all players.
* `/spark ping --player <username>` to view a specific players current ping RTT.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.ping`.

___
### `/spark tps`
The `tps` subcommand prints information about the servers TPS (ticks per second) rate and CPU usage.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.tps`.

___
### `/spark tickmonitor`
The `tickmonitor` subcommand controls the tick monitoring system.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.tickmonitor`.

Simply running the command without any extra flags will toggle the system on and off.

You can use:
* `/spark tickmonitor --threshold <percent>` to start the tick monitor, only reporting ticks which exceed a percentage increase from the average tick duration.
* `/spark tickmonitor --threshold-tick <milliseconds>` to start the tick monitor, only reporting ticks which exceed the given duration in milliseconds.
* `/spark tickmonitor --without-gc` to start the tick monitor, and disable reports about GC activity.

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faMemory} /> Memory

### `/spark gc`
The `gc` subcommand prints information about the servers GC (garbage collection) history.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.gc`.

___
### `/spark gcmonitor`
The `gcmonitor` subcommand controls the GC (garbage collection) monitoring system.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.gcmonitor`.

Simply running the command will toggle the system on and off.

___
### `/spark heapsummary`
The `heapsummary` subcommand generates a new memory (heap) dump summary and upload it to the viewer.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.heapsummary`.

You can use:
* `/spark heapsummary --run-gc-before` to suggest that the JVM runs the garbage collector before the heap summary is generated. (*deprecated*)

___
### `/spark heapdump`
The `heapdump` subcommand generates a new heapdump (.hprof snapshot) file and saves to the disk.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.heapdump`.

You can use:
* `/spark heapdump --compress <type>` to specify that the heapdump should be compressed using the given type. The supported types are gzip, xz and lzma.
* `/spark heapdump --include-non-live` to specify that "non-live" objects (objects that are not reachable and are eligible for garbage collection) should be included. (*deprecated*)
* `/spark heapdump --run-gc-before` to suggest that the JVM runs the garbage collector before the heap dump is generated. (*deprecated*)

## <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faBook} /> Misc

### `/spark activity`
The `activity` subcommand prints information about recent activity performed by spark.

Requires the permission `spark` or `spark.activity`.

You can use:
* `/spark activity --page <page no>` to view a specific page.
